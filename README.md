# ofxTextSuite

ofxTextSuite is an openFrameworks addon aims to ease the process of text creation and manipulation. 

# Features
- Fit text into a specific width and height area.
- Set the text alignment left, right, center, and justified.
- Animate text via fade in/out effect. This feature requires [ofxTweenzor](https://github.com/NickHardeman/ofxTweenzor).
- Use multiple fonts in a single textblock object via tags similar to html markup language.
- Use ofxTextSuite's font loader by passing the font location as argument.
- Use a preloaded ofTrueTypeFont variable to draw text with ofxTextSuite. This is useful for using custom fonts loaded with specific character ranges in your project.

# Background
This project has been transferred to [Furkan Üzümcü](https://github.com/Furkanzmc) from [Luke Malcolm](https://github.com/lukemalcolm). Furkan transferred the project to me at last. Thanks to contributors, maintainers and creators of the addon.
